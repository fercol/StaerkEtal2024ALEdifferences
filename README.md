# Reproducibility code for Staerk et al. (2024)

Here we provide code, data and a tutorial showing how the analyses for the study were carried out. The repository includes three directories:

- **01code**: with two R scripts, *ALEdifferencesCode.R* which is the main script that should be ran to reproduce the analyses, and *ALEdifferencesFunctions.R* which installs the necessary libraries and load several of the functions needed for the analyses.
- **02data**: with two sub-directories:
  - ***rdata***: with the file *fullphylo.RData* that contains the full phylogeny for birds and mammals
  - ***tables***: with five data files described in the tutorial.
- **03turorial**: with the file ***ALEdifferencesTutorial.pdf*** with a step by step tutorial explaining the code in ***01code/ALEdifferencesCode.R***.

The current release is available at the Zenodo repository [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/848168511.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15183248)
